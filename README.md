Assignment for Human Computer Interaction 

This assignment focuses on creating an application used for school purposes, for an application that will allow users to view their course content, assignments, grades, and chat with other students and the professor directly. There is a lot of improvements I would like to make to the application and the design, however, they are things I did not have a chance to add yet. 

Some of the features that I would like to add in future iterations are:

The ability to view assignment descriptions and what you need to do for an assignment on the assignments page

The ability to message specific users directly in order to collaborate on projects

To have a calendar that will show upcoming due dates, class schedule, and more

To be able to connect with a tutor in order to ask questions for assignments

The ability to video call with group members on the application itself

This is because I want to make it an all encompassing application
